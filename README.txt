# Planet Gravity Sandbox

**Planet Gravity Sandbox** is a physics simulation project developed using Unity, created as the final assignment for the Game Physics course during my third year at Champlain College. The simulation allows users to spawn, edit, and observe planets orbiting around a central sun, incorporating real-time physics interactions such as gravity and collisions.

## Features
- **Planet Interaction**: Spawn new planets, edit existing ones, and remove planets from the simulation.
- **Real-Time Editing**: Modify planet attributes like mass and size during runtime, affecting their gravitational influence.
- **Gravity Simulation**: Planets interact with each other and the sun based on realistic gravitational physics.
- **Collision Detection**: Planets can collide, with the simulation handling these events appropriately.

## Development Highlights
- **Physics Implementation**: Applied real-world orbital velocity formulas within Unity's physics engine, utilizing vectors and rigid bodies to simulate planetary motion.
- **Sandbox Mechanics**: Developed a dynamic environment where users can place, delete, and edit planets during simulation, enhancing interactivity.
- **UI Development**: Created an intuitive edit menu using Unity's UI system, enabling users to adjust planet properties seamlessly.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Ensured that all changes and interactions occur in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback.

## What I Learned
This project deepened my understanding of applying theoretical physics concepts to practical coding scenarios. It also enhanced my skills in UI programming, particularly in creating editable menus for runtime adjustments. Moving forward, I aim to develop more tools that facilitate the game development process for designers and artists.
